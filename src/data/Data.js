(But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced \u201cwhy-nab\u201d). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google us</a>, or read some of our <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ynab-you-need-a-budget/id1010865877\" rel=\"nofollow\">reviews on the app store</a>, and you\u2019ll see what we mean. We love building something that <em>literally</em> changes people\u2019s lives, and we have an impressive (if we do say so ourselves) ecosystem of apps, live classes, and stellar support.</p>\n<p>Now we need our next visual designer to bring the same attention to detail to our branding, marketing, and educational materials.</p>\n<p>You come to the table with some experience under your belt. You know how to uphold meticulous brand guidelines. You catch color mismatches that are mere shades off, you bristle at poor kerning, and you know that good design is in the details. You feel just as comfortable with the pen tool as you do responsive breakpoints. You also love to dream and get that our dream is to build a brand that is fun, smart, and approachable.</p>\n<div class=\"h3\"><strong>\u2028\u2028</strong></div>\n<div class=\"h3\"><strong>Requirements (these are real, actual requirements):</strong></div>\n<ul>\n<li>At least two years of experience working in marketing design.</li>\n<li>Experience working within strict, existing brand guidelines.</li>\n<li>Experience editing and working with vector artwork.</li>\n<li>Experience doing time-sensitive production work.</li>\n<li>Experience designing responsive web pages.</li>\n<li>Ability to work and communicate effectively in a remote environment.</li>\n<li>Your home base must be located +/- two hours from Central Standard Time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That\u2019s a super-brief intro of what you\u2019ll be working on. But first, you need to know if you\u2019ll even like working with us. We think you will.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven\u2019t taken any outside funding\u2014we\u2019re in it for the long haul. We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit\" rel=\"nofollow\">Core Value Manifesto</a> has to really click with you. If you\u2019re nodding emphatically while reading it, you\u2019d probably really like it here, and we can\u2019t wait to hear from you!</p>\n<p>But first, let\u2019s talk about life at YNAB and then we\u2019ll go into more detail about what we\u2019re looking for.</p>\n<div class=\"h2\">\u00a0</div>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Who You\u2019ll Be Working With:</strong></div>\n<p><strong>Lindsey</strong>, our Chief Marketing Officer, is in charge of getting the word out about YNAB, and always finds a fun way to do that. Like our <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/iynab/sets/budgeting-hits-2016\" rel=\"nofollow\">YNAB mix-tape</a>, where-in she wrote and re-recorded budgeting-related lyrics to pop-songs. (We suggest reading the rest of this description while listening to that album.)</p>\n<p><strong>Reema,</strong> our Marketing Production Manager, keeps all the balls in the air while wearing many different hats, basically, if there is a need, yo, she\u2019ll solve it (and yes, that was a seamless incorporation of Vanilla Ice lyrics).</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong> is our brand owner, and is possibly the most prolific, versatile designer that has ever lived (eat your heart out, Leo Da Vinci!!!). Illustration? Check. Print design? Definitely. Web Design? Yep. She even taught herself motion design in like a week and made an explainer video for us that lived on our site for several years. But she\u2019s also possibly the most humble person that has ever existed, which is why you also might not know that she\u2019s a published Fantasy author and was once ranked as a top ten Symmetra player. She\u2019s great.</p>\n<p><strong>Marian</strong>, our visual designer, is single-handedly responsible for almost all of the illustrations you see on our blog/Facebook/Instagram posts and was the creator of the cutest mascot in the world (at least we like to think so!), <a href=\"https://www.youneedabudget.com/15-hacks-for-working-from-home/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Banksy the Piggy Bank</a>. She also designed all the beautiful emails that you may have received when you signed up for YNAB. Did we mention that she\u2019s bi-lingual and vamos a terminar esta descripci\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1ol para ver si tu eres biling\u00fce tambi\u00e9n.</p>\n<div class=\"h1\">\u00a0</div>\n<div class=\"h1\"><strong>How You\u2019ll Work at YNAB</strong></div>\n<p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience (we\u2019ve even been named <a href=\"https://fortune.com/best-small-workplaces/you-need-a-budget/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fortune\u2019s #1 Best Small Company to Work For</a>) and have a team full of truly exceptional people\u2014the kind you\u2019ll be excited to work with. Here\u2019s how we operate:</p>\n<div class=\"h3\"><strong>Live Where You Want</strong></div>\n<p>We\u2019ve always been a fully remote team, and have people all over the world. For this particular position, however, we're looking for someone within +/- two hours of Central Standard Time, due to the high amount of synchronous coordination needed with the rest of the team. Anywhere within those time zones is okay, though. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</p>\n<div class=\"h3\"><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong></div>\n<p>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we\u2019re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</p>\n<div class=\"h3\"><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously)</strong></div>\n<p>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It\u2019s important to get out and do something. We\u2019ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our #office_wall Slack channel.</p>\n<div class=\"h3\"><strong>The YNAB Retreat</strong></div>\n<p>When the pandemic isn\u2019t keeping us from traveling, we get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we\u2019ve done <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fs1TN-jrDI&amp;t\" rel=\"nofollow\">Costa Rica</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/\" rel=\"nofollow\">gigantic cabin</a> in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and most recently, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js5pNTDKiZE\" rel=\"nofollow\">Laguna Beach</a>. We work together, play together, and reinforce the bonds we\u2019ve made as a team and company. Every year, we leave refreshed, motivated, and excited for the year ahead together.</p>\n<div class=\"h3\"><strong>Up Your Game</strong></div>\n<p>We\u2019re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, online courses and subscriptions, dedicated time away from work to learn something new\u2026 it\u2019s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing.</p>\n<div class=\"h3\"><strong>International is Absolutely Okay</strong></div>\n<p>If you are Stateside, we\u2019ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you\u2019re international, you\u2019ll be set up as a contractor. (Employee or contractor, it\u2019s all the same to us. You\u2019re part of the team!) As mentioned, we have some time zone restrictions for this role, but as long as you're within +/- two hours of Central Standard Time, we're good!</p>\n<div class=\"h3\">\u00a0</div>\n<div class=\"h3\"><strong>Benefits</strong></div>\n<p>For our U.S. employees, we offer fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you <em>and your family</em>. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, we\u2019ve got you covered!)</p>\n<p>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB matches your contributions, up to six percent of your paycheck. Matches vest immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder, Jesse? He set up YNAB\u2019s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, <em>not your retirement nest egg</em>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You\u2019re not a PF junkie? Trust us, it\u2019s awesome.)</p>\n<div class=\"h3\">\u00a0</div>\n<div class=\"h3\"><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></div>\n<ul>\n<li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your \u201cBucket List\u201d spreadsheet with 50 items. (That\u2019s harder than it sounds!)</li>\n<li>The bucket list really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and the holidays.</li>\n<li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You\u2019ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li>\n<li>We\u2019re all adults. There\u2019s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor. We look at what you accomplish, not how long you're\u00a0in front of a computer.</li>\n<li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we\u2019ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li>\n<li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people\u2019s lives? You may not think that matters much, but then a few months down the road you\u2019ll realize it\u2019s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don\u2019t underestimate this one!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. You will play a big, big part in helping the YNAB brand come to life and reach wider audiences. I\u2019ll only say that six more times.</p>\n<div class=\"h1\">\u00a0</div>\n<div class=\"h1\"><strong>Now, back to you, our new Visual Designer\u2026</strong></div>\n<p>As a visual designer at YNAB, you\u2019ll be a prized resource for our marketing team, churning out ads, landing pages, and supplementary graphics while maintaining the YNAB brand. You\u2019ll work alongside our writer and web developer to help maintain our website, and you\u2019ll lend your design skills to a variety of cross-team projects that span the YNAB ecosystem. You will be our boots on the ground, protecting our brand with your pixel-perfect attention to detail.</p>\n<div class=\"h3\"><strong>What Success Looks Like:</strong></div>\n<p>The marketing team marvels at your ability to think big and execute quickly on the smallest of tasks. You roll up your sleeves and deliver what\u2019s needed, sometimes before the team even asks for it. Other designers can\u2019t stop praising you for your museum-worthy ads and strict approach to file management. You\u2019ll probably make our CEO cry from time to time. Your campaigns are so beautiful he can barely look at them without bringing out a tissue. You also make us laugh. We like to laugh.</p>\n<p>You take direction from multiple teams, and communicate freely. You understand that great communication and time management is critical to your success in a remote work environment. When you say it will be done, it will be done. Your teammates don\u2019t even have to think about it.</p>\n<p>You know a great designer loves the very smallest parts of the job. Some call it pixel pushing. Others call it production work. We call it craft. You love seeing your designs come to life in the browser and communicate easily with developers, including in HTML and CSS. Because that\u2019s how it\u2019s done.</p>\n<p>Finally, the success of a designer at YNAB hinges upon the ability to approach design as holistic problem-solving for both creative and business goals. We work collaboratively here and you\u2019ll listen to (devour, really) ideas, questions, and critiques from teammates with grace and patience.</p>\n<p>That said, you know your stuff and can eloquently and logically explain design decisions. You see this type of exchange as critical to the success of yourself and our company: it is through sharing ideas and being open to the brilliance of others that we arrive at the best solutions.</p>\n<div class=\"h3\"><strong>You\u00a0are our ideal candidate if:</strong></div>\n<ul>\n<li>You have at least two years of experience working in marketing design.</li>\n<li>You are intimately familiar with design software, especially Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.</li>\n<li>You understand the value of brand consistency and always ensure that your work upholds existing standards\u2014even if they\u2019re at odds with your personal style.</li>\n<li>You may not be an illustrator, but you know the pen tool in and out and can manipulate vector art assets without breaking a sweat.</li>\n<li>You are productive and independent, able to produce high quality work within tight deadlines.</li>\n<li>You\u2019re not a coder, but you have a solid knowledge of the tech side of web design. You understand web standards and are a champion of good usability.</li>\n<li>You have experience designing responsive web pages and running A/B tests.</li>\n<li>You strive to continuously improve your craft, enjoy learning from others, and find joy in exploring new techniques, tools, and skills.</li>\n<li>You are an excellent communicator and understand how crucial it is for remote work.</li>\n<li>You believe in good file management and version control, and have experience working within shared file libraries.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h3\"><strong>Bonus points if:</strong></div>\n<ul>\n<li>You already use and love YNAB.</li>\n<li>You have a working knowledge of HTML and CSS.</li>\n<li>You have experience working in Figma.</li>\n<li>You could write a bit of placeholder copy, no sweat.</li>\n<li>You love to draw and could illustrate in a predefined style in a pinch.</li>\n<li>You can communicate in English and Spanish.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h3\"><strong>Some\u00a0things you'll be doing at YNAB:</strong></div>\n<ul>\n<li>Working with our content team to brainstorm and produce ad campaigns.</li>\n<li>Using existing components to design new landing pages or update old ones.</li>\n<li>Creating supplementary assets for blog posts (such as infographics).</li>\n<li>Maintaining a shared library of artwork that is used across the company.</li>\n<li>Serving as a design resource for various cross-team projects, creating everything from one-sheets to social media posts\u2014if someone needs it, you\u2019ve got it handled!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"h1\"><strong>How to Apply:</strong></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Apply below by 11:59PM PST on Sunday February 28, 2021.</strong> Firm.
